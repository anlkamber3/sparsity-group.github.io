Hi. I'm Rahul Parhi. This is my site.

There isn't too much here (actually, there isn't anything here), but feel free
to look around. Eventually I'll add more stuff (hopefully within the next 50
years!), but for now it's a work in progress (when I say work in progress, I
mean I'm not working on it at all).

### Brief Biography


I'm currently a 1<sup>st</sup> [Electrical
Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/)
Ph.D. student at the [University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).

Before that, I had graduated from the [University of Minnesota&ndash;Twin
Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) in May 2018 with a B.S. in
[Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/), B.S. in [Computer
Science](https://www.cs.umn.edu/), and a minor in
[Physics](https://www.physics.umn.edu/). While I was an undergraduate, I spent
two summers interning at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

#### About this site

This site is built using the [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site
generator.  Everything is written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using <a
href="http://www.vim.org/"><img class="dark-shadow"
style='vertical-align:middle;' alt="Vim" title="Vim" src="/img/vim.svg"
height="35"></a> (never `emacs`, unless, of course, you use [evil
mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil)).  The design of this site was made
by [me](. "recursion, we meet again"), that's why it's so ugly.

Hello, I am Rahul Parhi. This is my website.

In September 2022 I will join the [Biomedical Imaging
Group](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/) at the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de
Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) as a postdoctoral researcher, where I
will be supervised by [Michael Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/).

In July 2022 I defended my Ph.D. in [Electrical
Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/)
at the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I
was advised by [Robert D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). I was supported
by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I am generally interested in applied mathematics with particular interests in
applications of functional and harmonic analysis to problems in signal
processing and data science. My Ph.D. research studied the extremal properties
of splines and neural networks in a new family of Banach spaces which are, in
essence, bounded variation (BV) spaces defined via the Radon transform. For more
information, you can take a look at some of my [papers](/papers/).

If you would like to know more about me (because I'm such an interesting
person), feel free to look at my

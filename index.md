I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/){target="_blank"} at
[UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/){target="_blank"}. I joined
[UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/){target="_blank"} in 2024. Before that, I was a
postdoctoral researcher at the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
(EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/){target="_blank"} from 2022 to 2024, where I
worked with [Michael Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/){target="_blank"}. I
completed my Ph.D. in 2022 at the [University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/){target="_blank"}, where I was
supervised by [Robert D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/){target="_blank"}.

**&#9733; I am actively recruiting Ph.D. students to begin in Fall 2025 as well
as postdocs who are generally interested in the mathematics of data science. If
you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with (i) your CV
and (ii) a list of topics you are interested in.**

My research lies at the interface between functional and harmonic analysis,
signal processing, machine learning, and nonparametric statistics. I am
primarily interested in the **mathematics of data science** with a particular
emphasis on the foundations of **neural networks** and **deep learning**. Some
questions my research aims to answer include:

1. What is the effect of regularization in deep learning?
2. What kinds of functions do neural networks learn?
3. Why do neural networks seemingly break the curse of dimensionality?

Other topics/keywords that catch my attention include
**computed tomography**,
**inverse problems**,
**sparsity**,
**splines**,
**time--frequency analysis**, and
**wavelets**.
For more information, you can take a look at some of my [papers](/papers/).

Hello, I am Rahul Parhi. This is my website.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the [Biomedical Imaging
Group](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/) at the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de
Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I
am supervised by [Michael Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/).

**I am on the 2023--2024 academic job market.**

In July 2022 I defended my Ph.D. in [Electrical
Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/)
at the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I
was supervised by [Robert D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). There, my
dissertation recieved the [Harold Peterson Outstanding Dissertation
Award](https://engineering.wisc.edu/blog/2023-ece-department-awards-reception-highlights-excellence/).
During my Ph.D., I was supported by an [NSF Graduate Research
Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I am generally interested in topics that lie at the interface between
functional/harmonic analysis and the data sciences.  My primary area of
investigation is in the development of the mathematical foundations of **neural
networks** and **deep learning** with the goal of understanding:

1. What is the effect of regularization in deep learning?
2. What kinds of functions do neural networks learn?
3. Why do neural networks seemingly break the curse of dimensionality?

My research uses tools from mathematical signal processing, functional/harmonic
analysis, nonparametric statistics, and nonlinear approximation theory to answer
these questions.

Other topics/keywords that catch my attention include
**computed tomography**,
**inverse problems**,
**sparsity**,
**splines**,
**time--frequency analysis**, and
**wavelets**.

For more information, you can
take a look at some of my [papers](/papers/).

person), feel free to look at my

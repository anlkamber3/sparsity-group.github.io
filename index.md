Hello, I am Rahul Parhi. This is my website.

I'm currently an [Electrical
Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/)
Ph.D. student at the [University of
Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I am advised by [Robert
D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). I also received an M.S. in [Electrical
Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/)
from the [University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) in 2019.

I am interested using tools from applied mathematics (functional analysis,
harmonic analysis, approximation theory) and signal processing (inverse
problems, sparsity-promoting signal recovery, splines) to understand
mathematical problems pertaining to data science.  For more information, you can
take a look at some of my [papers](/papers/).

Before coming to Madison, I  completed my undergraduate studies at the
[University of Minnesota&ndash;Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), where
I received a B.S. in [Mathematics](https://math.umn.edu/), a B.S. in [Computer
Science](https://www.cs.umn.edu/), and a minor in
[Physics](https://www.physics.umn.edu/), all in 2018. While I was an
undergraduate student, I spent two summers working at
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) in Seattle, Washington.

If you would like to know more about me (because I'm such an interesting
person), feel free to look at my

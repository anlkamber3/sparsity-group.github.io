R&#233;sum&#233;
------

My r&#233;sum&#233; is available in several formats:

* [`yaml`](/resume-yaml/)
* [`pdf`](https://files.rahul.sh/rahulparhi_resume.pdf)
    - If you think my `pdf` r&#233;sum&#233; looks neat, you can use the
      [`cv.cls`](https://gitlab.com/rp/texmf/blob/master/tex/latex/rahul/cv.cls)
      \\(\\text{\\LaTeX}\\) class I wrote for it. This \\(\\text{\\LaTeX}\\)
      class was heavily inspired by Trey Hunner's
      [`resume.cls`](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume) and
      [`moderncv`](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv?lang=en)
      but written from scratch just for fun.
* HTML version coming soon!

Resume

A PDF of my resume is a available
[here](http://files.rahul.sh/rahulparhi_resume.pdf). HTML version coming soon!

If you think my resume looks neat, you can use the
[`cv.cls`](https://gitlab.com/rp/texmf/blob/master/tex/latex/rahul/cv.cls) <span
class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> class I wrote for it. I'll
leave you to figure out how to use it yourself.

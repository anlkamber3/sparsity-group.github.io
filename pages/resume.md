Resume
------

A PDF of my resume is a available
[here](https://files.rahul.sh/rahulparhi_resume.pdf). HTML version coming soon!

If you think my resume looks neat, you can use the
[`cv.cls`](https://gitlab.com/rp/texmf/blob/master/tex/latex/rahul/cv.cls)
\\(\\text{\\LaTeX}\\) class I wrote for it. This \\(\\text{\\LaTeX}\\) class was
heavily inspired by Trey Hunner's
[`resume.cls`](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume) and
[`moderncv`](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv?lang=en)
but written from scratch just for fun.

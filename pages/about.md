About
-----

I (recently) graduated from the the [University of Minnesota&mdash;Twin Cities](http://twin-cities.umn.edu/)
with a B.S. in [Mathematics](http://math.umn.edu/),
B.S. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.umn.edu/),
and a minor in [Physics](http://www.physics.umn.edu/) in May 2018.

### Site

This site is built using the [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site
generator.  All the content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using
<a href="http://www.vim.org/"><img class="dark-shadow" style='vertical-align:middle;' alt="Vim" title="Vim" src="/img/vim.svg" height="35"></a>.
The design of this site was made by [me](. "recursion, we meet again"), that's why it's so ugly.

The source for this site can be found on GitLab
[here](https://gitlab.com/rp/site).

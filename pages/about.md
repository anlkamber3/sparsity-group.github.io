About
-----

I'm currently an undergraduate student at the [University of Minnesota &ndash;
Twin Cities](http://twin-cities.umn.edu/) double majoring in
[Mathematics](http://math.umn.edu/) and [Computer Science](http://www.cs.umn.edu/),
minoring in [Physics](http://www.physics.umn.edu/). I plan to graduate in May of
2018.

### Site

This site is built using the [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site
generator.  All the content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using
<a href="http://www.vim.org/"><img class="dark-shadow" style='vertical-align:middle;' alt="Vim" title="Vim" src="/img/vim.svg" height="35"></a>.
The design of this site was made by [me](. "recursion, we meet again"), that's why it's so ugly.

The source for this site can be found on GitHub [here](http://github.com/rp/rp.github.io/tree/dev/).

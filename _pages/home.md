The **S**ignals, **P**atterns, **A**daptivity, **R**egularization,
**S**tatistics, and **I**nformation **T**heor**Y** (SPARSITY) research group at
the University of California, San Diego ([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)), led by
[Prof. Rahul Parhi](/rahul/), pursues **fundamental research** at the interface between
functional and harmonic analysis, signal processing, machine learning,
nonparametric statistics, and optimization. Our primary research interests and
efforts are in the **mathematics of data science** with a particular focus on
developing the foundations of **neural networks** and **deep learning** using
tools from **sparsity** and **sparse regularization**.

Our research efforts often overlap with many areas of **applied mathematics**
including the geometry of Banach spaces, inverse problems, the mathematics of
computed tomography, stochastic processes, the theory of distributions,
time--frequency analysis, and wavelets. As a by-product, we have also made
several contributions to these areas as well. For more information, you can take
a look at our [papers](/papers/).


**&#9733; We are always interested in recruiting <ins>self-motivated</ins> Ph.D.
students as postdocs with a <ins>strong background in mathematics</ins> who are
generally interested in the mathematics of data science. If you are interested
in joining us, please send an email to [Prof. Rahul Parhi](/rahul/) with (i)
your CV and (ii) a list of topics you are interested in.**

      \footnotesize{Developed and implemented an efficient {\em privacy-preserving}
      cryptographic presence protocol. The notion of presence protocol is for one
      to advertise to their `buddies' if they are online. This is usually
      implemented such that the `central server' knows the entire graph structure
      of the social network. We proposed MP3---the Minnesota Private Presence
      Protocol---an efficient presence protocol that leaks {\bf no} information
      about the social graph and maintains forward secrecy in the event of a
      compromise. We wrote a discrete-event simulator to analyze the performance
      of our proposed protocol. This work was supported by a UROP award. An arXiv
      preprint of this work is currently available (see Publications).}

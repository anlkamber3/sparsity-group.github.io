I am an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering
([ECE](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/)) at the University of California, San Diego
([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)), which I joined in 2024.  Previously, I was a
postdoctoral researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)) from 2022 to 2024, where I worked with
[Michael Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/). I obtained my Ph.D. in 2022 at
the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison
([UW&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/)), where I was supervised by [Robert
D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). I completed my undergraduate studies at
the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities ([UMN](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/))
in 2018.

My research lies at the interface between functional and harmonic analysis,
signal processing, machine learning, nonparametric statistics, and optimization.
I am primarily interested in the **mathematics of data science** with a
particular focus on the foundations of **neural networks** and **deep
learning**. Some questions my research aims to answer include:

1. What is the effect of regularization in deep learning?
2. What kinds of functions do neural networks learn?
3. Why do neural networks seemingly break the curse of dimensionality?

Other topics/keywords that catch my attention include
**computed tomography**,
**geometry of Banach spaces**,
**inverse problems**,
**sparsity**,
**splines**,
**time--frequency analysis**, and
**wavelets**.
For more information, you can take a look at my [papers](/papers/).

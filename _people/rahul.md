### About

I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
([ECE](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/)) at the University of California, San Diego
([UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/)), which I joined in 2024. From 2022 to 2024, I was a
Postdoctoral Researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne
([EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)), where I worked with [Michael
Unser](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/). I obtained my Ph.D. in 2022 at the
University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison
([UW&ndash;Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/)), where I was supervised by [Robert
D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). There, my dissertation received the
[Harold Peterson Outstanding Dissertation
Award](https://engineering.wisc.edu/blog/2023-ece-department-awards-reception-highlights-excellence/).
I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
([UMN](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/)) in 2018.

My research lies at the interface between functional analysis, signal
processing, machine learning, nonparametric statistics, and optimization. My
primary area of investigation is in the **mathematics of data science** with a
focus on developing the foundations of **neural networks** and **deep
learning**. Some questions my research aims to answer include:

1. What is the effect of regularization in deep learning?
2. What kinds of functions do neural networks learn?
3. Why do neural networks seemingly break the curse of dimensionality?
4. Why are neural networks able to adapt to low-dimensional structures?

Other topics/keywords that catch my attention include
**compressed sensing**,
**computed tomography**,
**the geometry of Banach spaces**,
**inverse problems**,
**minimax rates**,
**optimal recovery**,
**sparsity**,
**splines**,
**time--frequency analysis**, and
**wavelets**.
For more detailed information about my research, you can take a look at my
[papers](/papers/).
